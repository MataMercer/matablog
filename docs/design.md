# Note

## Developers

## Glossary


ActivityPub - A protocol over HTTP that allows for interop between completely different blogging websites.

Webfinger - A protocol over HTTP for looking up users. (at least for the purpose of this website).

## Purpose

This site is to provide an open source blogging platform following ActivityPub protocol. Users will be able to register accounts and post however they like. They can follow other users they are interested in. 

Many blogging platforms generally follow a specific niche. This blog is designed for illustrators. Illustrators can upload up to 25 images and post up to 5000 characters. This allows creators to post comics and longer form works. 

The front page of the site will help users find popular artists by ranking or tags. Furthermore, if e-commerce is added, this will market to users better. 




## Audience

The audience is for illustrators and art consumers. Given the site is open source, an illustrator could run this on their own server for their own personal website. 

## Technology

The technology for the backend will be Java and Spring Boot. Server side rendering will be done with Thymeleaf.

The client side rendering is done in React and TypeScript. Mainly logged in user tools will be done in React to add dynamicism to the website.

To improve search results, the SEO sensitive content such as images, post text, and tags relevant to the creator MUST be rendered statically without Javascript. Components that do not contain key words such as likes, follows, bookmarks, and comments can be rendered using React components. In other words content relevant to logged in users can be rendered in React.
